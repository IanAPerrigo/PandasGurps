Things complete:
-Basic visuals
-Turn mechanics
-Actors and behaviors
-Movement actions
-Action Resolver basics

Candidates of things to work on:

-Terrain
    Interesting features and environment provide movement obstacles
    Introduces skill challenges for traversing terrain

-Basic Combat
    Simple Melee attack:
        Weapon-less combat
        combat rolls, damage, etc
        Life cycle mechanics for actors (dying, unconsciousness, etc)

Watched a showcase of numba (used for optimizing python and numpy operations) might be useful for pathfinding, etc.

Genetics idea:
Each primary and secondary stat will be crossover sites. Pick a combination of both parent, then use normal distribution
to introduce noise (rho being the mutation factor).

Advantages, disadvantages, and innate skills will be passed on by selection:
- one idea, generate a number [0, 1] for each category and that is the percentage one of the parents gives to the child.
The rest of the percentage is how much the other parent gives. (This will mean duplicates will be more likely to be selected)
Introduce a small configurable mutation rate for each adv/dis/innate that will cause a random adv/dis/innate to be selected instead.

Learned skills (languages, non-innate skills, etc) must be TAUGHT.
Teaching will be an action that can be done between two actors with the same language (penalty otherwise).
Teaching is described in the gurps handbook (time to learn will need to be modified)

In order to allow children to learn easier, an innate language between parent and child will give bonuses to teaching.

Maneuvers = action objects
have internal structures depending on the maneuver type. Most likely a list of actions.
The maneuver resolve logic will be what validates the counts/order of each action.
