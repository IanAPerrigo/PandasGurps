Candidates of things to work on:

### NEW FEATURE ###
-Terrain
    Interesting features and environment provide movement obstacles
    Introduces skill challenges for traversing terrain

### DONE ###
-Basic Combat
    Simple Melee attack:
        Weapon-less combat
        combat rolls, damage, etc
        Life cycle mechanics for actors (dying, unconsciousness, etc)

### NEW FEATURE ###
Genetics idea:
Each primary and secondary stat will be crossover sites. Pick a combination of both parent, then use normal distribution
to introduce noise (rho being the mutation factor).

Advantages, disadvantages, and innate skills will be passed on by selection:
- one idea, generate a number [0, 1] for each category and that is the percentage one of the parents gives to the child.
The rest of the percentage is how much the other parent gives. (This will mean duplicates will be more likely to be selected)
Introduce a small configurable mutation rate for each adv/dis/innate that will cause a random adv/dis/innate to be selected instead.

Learned skills (languages, non-innate skills, etc) must be TAUGHT.
Teaching will be an action that can be done between two actors with the same language (penalty otherwise).
Teaching is described in the gurps handbook (time to learn will need to be modified)

In order to allow children to learn easier, an innate language between parent and child will give bonuses to teaching.

### DONE ###
- NOTE: done for movement only. Will change its shape if new actions require it to.
Maneuvers = action objects
have internal structures depending on the maneuver type. Most likely a list of actions.
The maneuver resolve logic will be what validates the counts/order of each action.

### BACKLOG IDEA ###
Visualization of un-executed moves and failed moves (like an obstacle is in the way)



### DONE ###
Modifiers and Status Effects (buffs adn de-buffs)

Reasons:
Modifiers to stats are required to implement certain status effects (shock, major damage, cripple).

Difficulties:
Currently, movement and combat reference the stat set directly, meaning each of these operate on base stats and no modifiers.
Ideally, the modified stat set should be accessed instead of the regular stat set and both stat sets should be consistent with each other.
The un-modified stat set should still be accessible (since any changes to base stats would happen there.


### PARTIALLY DONE ###
Life cycle mechanics

##Needs to be completed##
Recovery from unconsciousness and retain consciousness

Reasons:
- After combat, interaction with the environment, actors can take damage.
- Taking damage has many possible side effects (mostly debuffs and incapacitation/death).
- Currently debuffs have not been implemented (nothing to manage modifiers / debuffs) but to facilitate this
resolving actions should have access to managers that calculate when certain modifiers should be applied, etc.

DEPENDS ON: Status Effects and modifiers (unconsciousness and death are de-buffs)

Example: An actor takes a large amount of damage in combat. This will cause the 'Shock' debuff,  but the action
shouldnt have to implement this directly, since other things can cause shock (movement involving damage).

Debuffs would result after an action is resolved: either triggered by an interaction the action has with the game state,
or directly by the action (status effect).

Triggers:
- abstraction layer watching for changes (in this case for unconsciousness and death)
Flow:
1. action deals damage to actor.
2. right after the health is deducted from the total, an event is emitted for health changing.
3. Event handler(s) determine if any status effects are given to the actor.
4. After setting the valid status effect, a corresponding event is called to handle its effects on turn order (if they have any)

Unconsciousness:
Does not effect turn order, but effects what actions an actor can make on a turn (a forced action to try to regain consciousness)
and Do Nothing.


Turn management flow:
1. Construct turn for actor (advancing turn, generating state)
2. Attach callbacks and resources to ActorFSM for the current actor (callbacks are for submitting actions to be resolved)
3. Start the actorFSM by advancing its state (allowing it to start generating actions) and have main FSM wait in TurnLoop State
4. As actions are generated, the step_complete callback is called, this callback pulls all submitted actions and resolves them.
    4.a [addition]: during the resolution of actions (maneuvers in particular), an actor can die or go unconscious. This
    requires action resolvers to check the consciousness of the actor of a particular action before resolution.



### NEW FEATURE ###
Add skills to combat:

- Make combat depend on skills (innate attacks only to begin).

Dependencies:
- Requires skills to be done.

### NEW FEATURE ###
Add weapons to combat:

- Make combat depend on skills and weapons

Dependencies:
- Requires skills to be done.
- Requires inventory and weapons to be done.


### NEW FEATURE ###
Add stances and their bonuses (status effects) to combat:

- Allow maneuvers to modify the posture of the actor (crouching, laying down)
- Allow actors to take defensive maneuvers (all out)

### NEW FEATURE ###
Skills:

- Add learned and innate skills that can be used in certain circumstances.
-

### NEW FEATURE ###
Inventory and equipped items:

- Have items storable in wearable containers on the actor (in the inventory tree).
- Have natural storage locations for anything (hands)
- Have natural storage locations for wearable equipment (body parts)

Dependencies:
- Should require the hit locations structures to be at least added by name (non-functional is okay)


### NEW FEATURE ###
Energy system:

- Create a system to analyze the amount of FP used over time.
    - Sustained use of movement, combat or other actions deemed costly.
- Add "Harvest" and "Eat" actions.
    - Harvest: if target is disabled (unconscious, dead, pinned).
    Target can be an entity with the edible status effect.
    Automatic hit, deal Swing (CUT) damage and gain 1 meal's worth of food.
    When an entity receives the non-existent status, it can no longer be harvested.
    The idea is to have lower HP entities count for less food (weaker and generally smaller)
    Harvested food will be dropped on the floor. An general action to pick up will be added with inventory
    - Eat: consume food nearby or in a container you own
    Add status effect "Eaten N" where N is the number of meals eaten
- Missing a meal:
    A meal is missed if after 1/3 of the day, the actor doesnt have "Eaten 1"
    After a meal period has elapsed, remove a level of Eaten from the active eaten status. If none exists, gain a
    Starvation stack.
- Starvation:
    Starvation requires a whole day of rest + 3 whole meals.
    (might be extreme, here is a test case)
        Rest being interrupted can easily cause death, since anything can ust come along even if the actor ate and was resting.
        Might consider not having "all or nothing" regeneration (as per the rules).
        Consideration: If the actor can eat 3 meals in a day, each meal with the 'rest' buff, then the starvation is gone.
- Dehydration:
    - 2 quarts per day required
        - 8 drinks of water a day
    - Lose 1 FP every 8 hours
        - if less than 1 quart was drank in a day, lose an extra 1 FP and 1 HP
            - Represented by "dehydration N" N being the number of periods of missed water.
            - "Severe dehydration N" is the number of days drinking less than a quart of water.
        - all dehydration debuffs can be removed by ample rest and normal water intake.
- Resting:
    Resting buff is awarded when strenuous activity is avoided for a period of time.
    - Strenuous movement: > 40% maximum movement.
    - Any combat
    - Lifting Extra-Heavy loads (overexertion)
    - Dehydration or starvation nullifies the effects of rest.
    - Rest periods and status-effects
        - Every 10m of rest: +1 FP or +2 with food
    - Sleep:
        - 1 FP per hour uninterrupted
        - Required in last 24 hours otherwise incur penalties (the only reason to do it, since rest is more efficient)

Breakdown (large feature):

- Add harvest and eat first, and the status effects given from eating.
- Next, add non-actor entities that count as food (maybe a status effect "edible")
    - Also add meal entities that will eventually be able to be picked up.
- Next add a simple 'tick' event system where each turn the tick counter is incremented and an event is sent out.
    A note about this, statuses not tied directly to tick, a status_update event will be called from the tick event
    to keep order of operations in case some priority needs to arise. The status_update will handle registration of
    status updates on particular tick numbers.
- Next modify the "eaten" and 'drank' status to be applied on character creation (both at level 0)
    Data associated with each status should be:
        Period begin tick (so day intervals can be calculated to apply the starvation and dehydration updates)
- Next, have the "EnergyHandler" event handler schedule events on status_update_manager for future status updates.
    - A decision point here: should extra food eaten in a day be a reward?
        Maybe at the expiration of the food period for the day, only 3 meals are subtracted, allowing anything else to
        be a sort of "reserve". So an actor with extra food intake can survive without food longer (only works for food)


### FEATURE IDEA ###
Due to balancing concerns, the time frames between micro-gurps and macro-gurps could create a nightmare for simulation.
Add an option to compress or expand time:

Reasoning:
Having every second being simulated when macro-gurps deals with hours and days could be excruciating to test out features.
Time dilation controls could scale time to divide based on the day, e.g. instead of 86,400 iterations per day, a factor
of 10x could make only 8640 turns per day (easier to simulate longer term behaviors).

Other things might need to be done to ease computation, such as if an entity is not in the observation area of any other
entity and the entity is resting / sleeping, dont consider it an actor.



### IDEA ###
Add decorators for common action related tasks (checking proximity, checking ranging, consciousness, )
