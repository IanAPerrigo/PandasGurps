Energy system:

- Create a system to analyze the amount of FP used over time.
    - Sustained use of movement, combat or other actions deemed costly.
- Add "Harvest" and "Eat" actions.
    - Harvest: if target is disabled (unconscious, dead, pinned).
    Target can be an entity with the edible status effect.
    Automatic hit, deal Swing (CUT) damage and gain 1 meal's worth of food.
    When an entity receives the non-existent status, it can no longer be harvested.
    The idea is to have lower HP entities count for less food (weaker and generally smaller)
    Harvested food will be dropped on the floor. An general action to pick up will be added with inventory
    - Eat: consume food nearby or in a container you own
    Add status effect "Eaten N" where N is the number of meals eaten
- Missing a meal:
    A meal is missed if after 1/3 of the day, the actor doesnt have "Eaten 1"
    After a meal period has elapsed, remove a level of Eaten from the active eaten status. If none exists, gain a
    Starvation stack.
- Starvation:
    Starvation requires a whole day of rest + 3 whole meals.
    (might be extreme, here is a test case)
        Rest being interrupted can easily cause death, since anything can ust come along even if the actor ate and was resting.
        Might consider not having "all or nothing" regeneration (as per the rules).
        Consideration: If the actor can eat 3 meals in a day, each meal with the 'rest' buff, then the starvation is gone.
- Dehydration:
    - 2 quarts per day required
        - 8 drinks of water a day
    - Lose 1 FP every 8 hours
        - if less than 1 quart was drank in a day, lose an extra 1 FP and 1 HP
            - Represented by "dehydration N" N being the number of periods of missed water.
            - "Severe dehydration N" is the number of days drinking less than a quart of water.
        - all dehydration debuffs can be removed by ample rest and normal water intake.
- Resting:
    Resting buff is awarded when strenuous activity is avoided for a period of time.
    - Strenuous movement: > 40% maximum movement.
    - Any combat
    - Lifting Extra-Heavy loads (overexertion)
    - Dehydration or starvation nullifies the effects of rest.
    - Rest periods and status-effects
        - Every 10m of rest: +1 FP or +2 with food
    - Sleep:
        - 1 FP per hour uninterrupted
        - Required in last 24 hours otherwise incur penalties (the only reason to do it, since rest is more efficient)

Breakdown (large feature):


# DONE # - Add harvest and eat first, and the status effects given from eating.
- Next, add non-actor entities that count as food (maybe a status effect "edible")
    # DONE # - Also add meal entities that will eventually be able to be picked up.
- Next add a simple 'tick' event system where each turn the tick counter is incremented and an event is sent out.
    A note about this, statuses not tied directly to tick, a status_update event will be called from the tick event
    to keep order of operations in case some priority needs to arise. The status_update will handle registration of
    status updates on particular tick numbers.
    - Further expand on this.
        The status effect object can be broken into a few types:
        # DONE # Countdown status effects: effects that expire after a period of time. This would be like shock, which ticks down over time.
        # DONE # Eternal status effects: always present like fed, hydrated, rest, etc.
            # DONE # Also: periodically updated
        # DONE # Triggered status effects: effects removed by certain circumstances
        TODO: more?
    # DONE # - Handling keeping track of when to update (or potentially remove) status effects.
        A generic way of updating a status effect from one place, without knowing the particulars of each status effect.
        This means, some level of self management is required, but the different classes of statuses are treated as such
        in a manager.

        Add an update_tick function to the status effect class.
        The update_tick function is only called when needed, and using a "next_relevant_tick" field in the status,
        excessive updates can be ignored.
        A flag controlling whether a status should be cleaned up will be the signal of if it should be removed.

        e.g. ShockStatus:
        # Generic fields from StatusEffect
        tick_added = 0
        tick_removed = None
        next_relevant_tick = 1 # Every turn, shock has a modifier reduction.
        active = True

        update_tick(current_tick, time_scale)
        # Update shock modifier
        # check if status has expired
        # if it has expired
            active = False
            next_relevant_tick = None
            # tick_removed will be set by the manager
        # if it didnt expire
            next_relevant_tick += time_scale # Because there is a change every tick (regardless of scale)

        - Now the manager either cleans up the status if it was deactivated or moves onto the next status.
        In the case of eternal statuses, they are never deactivated (unless dead) and have longer time horizons.
        Triggered status effects generally get deactivated when the event happens, assuming they wont need to be worried about here.
